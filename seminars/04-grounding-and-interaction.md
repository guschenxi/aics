* To what degree learning labels is natural language?
* Assigning labels is like image classification? The model ported from image classification to interactive reinforcement learning.
* Interactive? Very simple interaction: just agreeing. There are more complex forms of interaction: agreeing, correction, clarification; the model is very symmetrical; one person is describer the other is listener, but the roles could change
